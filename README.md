# zsh-vcs

Simple example of how to show VCS/virtualenv infos in your zsh prompt

It supports:

- git
    * it shows the HEAD name or a name related to the closest HEAD if in a detached HEAD.
- mercurial
    * shows the current branch
- svn
    * why are you still using svn?

## How to use it

The simplest (and laziest) way is to copy this at the end of your `.zshrc` configuration file.
